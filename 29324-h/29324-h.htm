<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The eighteenth century was an age addicted to gossiping about its
literary figures. This addiction was nowhere better demonstrated than
by the countless reflections, sermons, poems, pamphlets, biographical
sketches, and biographies about Samuel Johnson. The most productive
phase of this activity commenced almost immediately after Johnson's
death in December, 1784, and continued into the next century.</p>

<p>One item of Johnsoniana which seems to have been neglected, perhaps
because Birkbeck Hill did not include it in his <i>Johnsonian
Miscellanies</i>, is <i>A Poetical Review of the Literary and Moral
Character of the Late Samuel Johnson, L.L.D., with Notes</i>. This poem
of three hundred and four lines was written by John Courtenay
(1741-1816). First published in the spring of 1786 by Charles Dilly,
the poem went through three editions in the same year. Its popularity
was determined less by Courtenay's poetic talent than by public
interest in the Johnsoniana that flooded the market. Courtenay's
literary output, though scanty, was diverse; he wrote light verse,
character sketches, and essays, including two controversial pieces in
support of the French Revolution.<span class="fn"><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1"></a><a href="#f1">1</a></span> It is apparent, however, that for
him writing was hardly more than an avocation.</p>

<p>Despite his notoriety as a controversial member of Parliament, as a
first-rate wit, and as an intimate friend of Boswell, Courtenay
remains a shadowy figure. References to him occur often in the last
volumes of Boswell's journal, but few of them are particularly
revealing. Courtenay evidently never met Johnson; indeed, the
anonymous author of <i>A Poetical Epistle from the Ghost of Dr. Johnson
to His Four Friends: The Rev. Mr. Strahan. James Boswell, Esq. Mrs.
Piozzi. J. Courtenay, Esq. M.P.</i> (1786) censures Courtenay for writing
about a man whom he did not know. Although a member of the Literary
Club, Courtenay did not join this group until four years after Johnson
died. He was proposed on 9 December<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> 1788, by Sir Joshua Reynolds
(Boswell seconded), and elected two weeks later, on 23 December,
during the same meeting at which it was decided to erect a monument to
Dr. Johnson in Westminster Abbey.<span class="fn"><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1"></a><a href="#f2">2</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, Courtenay did not belong to the Johnson circle, he became,
shortly after Johnson's death, a valued member of the Boswell circle.
Courtenay must have met Boswell in the spring or early summer of 1785,
about thirteen years after arriving in England from his native Ireland
in the service of Viscount Townshend. Boswell's first reference to
Courtenay occurs in his journal under 7 July 1785.<span class="fn"><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1"></a><a href="#f3">3</a></span> It is clear from
this entry that he had met Courtenay earlier, but subsequent
references indicate that the acquaintance was a fresh one.</p>

<p>From the start Boswell enjoyed Courtenay's company. In the first
place, Boswell appreciated Courtenay's talent in conversation.
Although he seldom recorded specimens of Courtenay's talk, Boswell was
generous in his praise of his wit. "Courtenay's wit," he wrote,
"sparkles more than almost any man's."<span class="fn"><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1"></a><a href="#f4">4</a></span> On 26 March 1788, Boswell
described him as a "valuable addition" to a meeting of the Essex Head
Club which he attended as Boswell's guest. "Indeed," Boswell
continued, "his conversation is excellent; it has so much literature,
wit, and at the same time manly sense, in it."<span class="fn"><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1"></a><a href="#f5">5</a></span> An example of his
"manly sense" that "struck home" to Boswell was Courtenay's remark
that had Johnson been born to three thousand pounds a year his
melancholy would have been at greater leisure to torment him.<span class="fn"><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1"></a><a href="#f6">6</a></span></p>

<p>But there was a greater reason for Courtenay's intimacy with Boswell.
The period following Johnson's death was for Boswell a time of intense
anxiety. By 1786 Courtenay and Edmond Malone had become Boswell's
closest confidants. Boswell relished the long walks and the dinners he
took with Courtenay. Throughout his journal he confessed to the
therapeutic value of Courtenay's company; "I am," he admitted, "quite
another Man with M. C., Malone, Courtenay."<span class="fn"><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1"></a><a href="#f7">7</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, Boswell often solicited Courtenay's advice in various
crises. Courtenay, together with Malone, helped him out of scrapes
with Alexander Tytler and Lord Macdonald, induced him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> lighten his
published attacks on Mrs. Piozzi and helped make him aware of the
merit of her edition of Johnson's correspondence, and advised him to
cancel some questionable passages in the <i>Life</i> on William Gerard
Hamilton. From time to time he also cautioned Boswell not to expect
political preferment when he did not deserve it. It appears, too, that
he took part in the prolonged deliberations over Johnson's monument in
Westminster Abbey. Concerned that Boswell's drinking might impede his
work on the <i>Life</i>, Courtenay made him promise to quit drinking from
December 1790, to the following March, a promise which, as far as he
was able, Boswell kept.<span class="fn"><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1"></a><a href="#f8">8</a></span></p>

<p>Courtenay's high spirits and his ability to relieve Boswell's
melancholy were all the more remarkable because Courtenay, with a wife
and seven children to support, was poverty-stricken during most of
this period. Boswell, lamenting the failure of the Whigs to provide
financial assistance to one of the party's most active members, found
Courtenay's "firmness of mind ... amazing" under such difficulties.<span class="fn"><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1"></a><a href="#f9">9</a></span>
No doubt Courtenay's resolve endeared him to Boswell, whose own
financial and psychological problems were, of course, a great burden.</p>

<p>This is not to say that relations between the two men were always
cordial. Courtenay was evidently a non-believer, and the two men often
differed on religious matters. Boswell condemned Courtenay's "wild
ravings" in favor of the French revolution, and once confessed his
deep regret about quarreling with so close a friend on this
subject.<span class="fn"><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1"></a><a href="#f10">10</a></span> They also differed on the question of slavery, and
Boswell good-naturedly chided Courtenay and William Windham as
abolitionists in his poem, <i>No Abolition of Slavery; or the Universal
Empire of Love</i> (1791).<span class="fn"><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1"></a><a href="#f11">11</a></span> It is clear, too, that as Boswell's
depression grew, Courtenay's power to brighten his spirits waned
considerably. Their friendship, nevertheless, seems to have ended on a
happy note, for Boswell's final mention of Courtenay in his journal
includes the remark that with Courtenay he had spent a "good day."<span class="fn"><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1"></a><a href="#f12">12</a></span></p>

<p>Courtenay's <i>Poetical Review</i>, characterized by Donald A. Stauffer as
an embodiment of the "vice-and-virtue philosophy" in biography, was
one of the most spirited pieces of Johnsoniana to appear.<span class="fn"><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1"></a><a href="#f13">13</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> The
poem begins with disdain, but at line sixty-one reverses direction and
becomes vigorously commendatory. Courtenay did not attempt to add
fresh information about Johnson's life and career. Consequently, the
unfavorable portion of the poem is a conventional catalog of Johnson's
often publicized foibles and prejudices, just as the favorable section
is in part a commonplace survey of his artistic achievement.</p>

<p>This contrast, as Stauffer remarks, renders Courtenay's praise more
powerful.<span class="fn"><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1"></a><a href="#f14">14</a></span> More important, the play between scorn and praise
reflects the ambivalence which colors contemporary accounts of
Johnson. We are now accustomed to the notion of great art as the
product of a flawed life. But in the eighteenth century, an age
largely devoted to the idea of discreet biography which concealed or
minimized the subject's weaknesses, a man like Johnson presented
formidable problems to the biographer and his readers. Although
Courtenay merely versified material which other writers had discussed
in much more detail, his poem is important because it synthesizes the
conflicting attitudes towards Johnson which prevailed immediately
after his death. Courtenay, like many others, saw in Johnson a
powerful mixture of great virtues and vices; and though he is not
impartial, he effects, through his honesty, an admirable balance
between Johnson's strengths and weaknesses. The final forty lines of
the <i>Review</i> constitute one of the most balanced of all contemporary
tributes to Johnson as a human being.</p>

<p>For the most part, the commendatory section of the poem is an
unsystematic tracing of Johnson's moral and literary merits.
Courtenay's rhapsodizing on the <i>Dictionary</i>, the <i>Rambler</i>, and the
<i>Lives of the Poets</i> is conventional. Clearly, he admired the wide
scope of Johnson's learning and his ability to communicate his
knowledge of men and manners in his writings. But his admiration
occasionally betrays him; for instance, in describing the "brilliant
school" through which Johnson's influence was perpetuated, he
overestimated the extent to which Reynolds, Malone, Burney, Jones,
Goldsmith, Steevens, Hawkesworth, and Boswell were indebted to
Johnson's writings.<span class="fn"><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1"></a><a href="#f15">15</a></span> Usually, however, he was on firmer ground.
Courtenay was the only writer before Boswell to praise Johnson's Latin
verse, a body of poetry virtually ignored by other contemporary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
biographers and memorialists.<span class="fn"><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1"></a><a href="#f16">16</a></span> Furthermore, he employs footnotes
skillfully. Though they impede the progress of the poem, they do
support poetic statement with factual evidence and explain and amplify
certain points made in the verses.</p>

<p>The clearest evidence for the care which Courtenay took with the
<i>Review</i> can be found upon examination of his revisions. He made few
substantial changes in the second edition, but the third edition
contains important revisions. Courtenay added ten lines and five
footnotes in the final version, and lightened some of the scorn in the
first portion by substituting weaker phrases for stronger ones. He
also enclosed lines seven through twenty in quotation marks to make it
appear that the sentiment expressed therein was not his own, but a
judgment he had heard elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the most significant revisions are concerned with organization. By
transferring segments of certain verse paragraphs to others, he
achieves a more unified portrait of Johnson. By means of such
revision, he forms his general evaluation of Johnson's writing into
one unit and his comments on individual works into another, where
before they had been awkwardly interwoven.</p>

<p>Courtenay's <i>Review</i> did not go unnoticed at the time, though for
obvious reasons it was given less attention by the reviewers than the
more notorious Johnsoniana. Extracts from the poem were printed in
several magazines. The reviewers were almost unanimous in damning the
poem's inelegance, unevenness, and lack of harmony, but reserved
praise for the sentiments and candor.<span class="fn"><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1"></a><a href="#f17">17</a></span> Chesterfield's apologist in
William Hayley's <i>Two Dialogues; Containing a Comparative View of the
Lives, Characters, and Writings of Philip, the Late Earl of
Chesterfield, and Dr. Samuel Johnson</i> (1787) protested that Courtenay
was too kind to Johnson. The severest indictment of the Review came
from the anonymous author of <i>A Poetical Epistle from the Ghost of Dr.
Johnson</i>, mentioned earlier, who charged Courtenay with poor taste and
with belaboring the obvious by proving that Johnson was "not quite
destitute of brains."<span class="fn"><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1"></a><a href="#f18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest champion of the <i>Review</i> was, of course, Boswell. The
<i>Life</i> is sprinkled with quotations from the third edition, 118<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> lines
in all, mostly from Courtenay's commendatory verses. In view of the
many published attacks on Johnson, Boswell must have appreciated
Courtenay's sentiments all the more. Doubtless Courtenay's warm praise
of the <i>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</i> also found favor with
Boswell.<span class="fn"><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1"></a><a href="#f19">19</a></span> Perhaps Boswell's final and least partial judgment of the
<i>Review</i> was expressed in his letter to James Abercrombie of
Philadelphia dated 11 June 1792. He sent Abercrombie a copy of the
poem, commenting that "though I except to several passages, you will
find some very good writing."<span class="fn"><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1"></a><a href="#f20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Courtenay's <i>Review</i>, together with several other little known
<i>memorabilia</i> concerning Johnson, stimulated one of the most energetic
and splenetic literary controversies of the late eighteenth century.
In addition, the <i>Review</i> and pieces like it aroused a considerable
amount of useful, if vitriolic, discussion about the art of biography.</p>

Professor James M. Osborn of Yale University. Boswell gives no precise
date for Courtenay's entry into the Club. His first reference to
Courtenay's membership occurs in his journal entry of 19 January 1790.

<i>Private Papers</i>, XVIII, 100. Courtenay became alarmed over Boswell's
deepening melancholy, as seen in this passage from his letter to
Malone of 22 February 1791: "Poor Boswell is very low, &amp; desperate &amp;
... melancholy mad, feels no spring, no pleasure in existence, &amp; is so
perceptibly altered for the worse that it is remarked everywhere. I
try all I can to revivify him, but he [turns?] so tiresomely &amp;
tediously&mdash;for the same cursed trite commonplace topics, about death
&amp;c.&mdash;that we grow old, and when we are old, we are not young&mdash;that I
despair of effecting a cure. Doctors Warren and Devaynes very kindly
interest themselves about him, but you wd be of more service to him
than anyone." Quoted from a MS at Yale University Library by James
Osborn, "Edmond Malone and Dr. Johnson," <i>Johnson, Boswell and Their
Circle: Essays Presented to Lawrence Fitzroy Powell in Honour of His
Eighty-fourth Birthday</i> (Oxford, 1965), p. 16.</p>

A Generous tear will Caledonia shed?<br />
Her ancient foe, illustrious Johnson's dead;<br />
Mac-Ossian's sons may now securely rest,<br />
Safe from the bitter sneer, the cynick jest.<span class="fn"><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1"></a><a href="#f21">21</a></span><br />
The song of triumph now I seem to hear,<br />
And these the sounds that vibrate on my ear:<br />
"Low lies the man, who scarce deigns Gray to praise,<br />

Would ev'n submit to everlasting pain:<br />
How clear, how strong, such kindred colours paint<br />
The Roman epicure and Christian saint!<br />
O, had he liv'd in more enlighten'd times,<br />
When signs from heaven proclaim'd vile mortals' crimes,<br />
How had he groan'd, with sacred horrors pale,<br />
When Noah's comet shook her angry tail;<span class="fn"><a name="f39.1" id="f39.1"></a><a href="#f39">39</a></span><br />
That wicked comet, which Will Whiston swore<br />
Would burn the earth that she had drown'd before!<span class="fn"><a name="f40.1" id="f40.1"></a><a href="#f40">40</a></span><br />

Saw her young rabbets peep from Esdras' text!<span class="fn"><a name="f41.1" id="f41.1"></a><a href="#f41">41</a></span><br />
To him such signs, prepar'd by mystick grace,<br />
Had shewn the impending doom of Adam's race.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But who to blaze his frailties feels delight,</span><br />
When the great author rises to our sight?<br />
When the pure tenour of his life we view,<br />
Himself the bright exemplar that he drew?<br />
Whose works console the good, instruct the wise,<br />
And teach the soul to claim her kindred skies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By grateful bards his name be ever sung,</span><br />
Whose sterling touch has fix'd the English tongue!<br />
Fortune's dire weight, the patron's cold disdain,<br />
"Shook off, as dew-drops from the lion's mane;"<span class="fn"><a name="f42.1" id="f42.1"></a><a href="#f42">42</a></span><br />
Unknown, unaided, in a friendless state,<span class="fn"><a name="f43.1" id="f43.1"></a><a href="#f43">43</a></span><br />
Without one smile of favour from the great;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The bulky tome his curious care refines,<br />
Till the great work in full perfection shines;<br />
His wide research and patient skill displays<br />
What scarce was sketch'd in <span class="smcap">Anna</span>'s golden days;<span class="fn"><a name="f44.1" id="f44.1"></a><a href="#f44">44</a></span><br />
What only learning's aggregated toil<br />
Slowly accomplish'd in each foreign soil.<span class="fn"><a name="f45.1" id="f45.1"></a><a href="#f45">45</a></span><br />
Yet to the mine though the rich coin he trace,<br />
No current marks his early essays grace;<br />
For in each page we find a massy store<br />
Of English bullion mix'd with Latian ore:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>In solemn pomp, with pedantry combin'd,<br />
He vents the morbid sadness of his mind;<span class="fn"><a name="f46.1" id="f46.1"></a><a href="#f46">46</a></span><br />
In scientifick phrase affects to smile,<br />
Form'd on Brown's turgid Latin-English style:<span class="fn"><a name="f47.1" id="f47.1"></a><a href="#f47">47</a></span><br />
Too oft the abstract decorates his prose,<span class="fn"><a name="f48.1" id="f48.1"></a><a href="#f48">48</a></span><br />
While measur'd ternaries the periods close:<br />
But all propriety his Ramblers mock,<br />
When Betty prates from Newton and from Locke;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>When no diversity we trace between<br />
The lofty moralist and gay fifteen&mdash;<span class="fn"><a name="f49.1" id="f49.1"></a><a href="#f49">49</a></span><br />
Yet genius still breaks through the encumbering phrase;<br />
His taste we censure, but the work we praise:<br />
There learning beams with fancy's brilliant dyes,<br />
Vivid as lights that gild the northern skies;<br />
Man's complex heart he bares to open day,<br />
Clear as the prism unfolds the blended ray:<br />
The picture from his mind assumes its hue;<br />
The shades too dark, but the design still true.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Johnson's merits thus I freely scan,</span><br />
And paint the foibles of this wond'rous man;<br />
Yet can I coolly read, and not admire,<br />
When Learning, Wit and Poetry conspire<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>To shed a radiance o'er his moral page,<br />
And spread truth's sacred light to many an age?<br />
For all his works with innate lustre shine,<br />
Strength all his own, and energy divine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While through life's maze he sent a piercing view,</span><br />
His mind expansive to the object grew.<br />
With various stores of erudition fraught,<br />
The lively image, the deep-searching thought,<br />
Slept in repose;&mdash;but when the moment press'd,<br />
The bright ideas flood at once confess'd;<span class="fn"><a name="f50.1" id="f50.1"></a><a href="#f50">50</a></span><br />
Instant his genius sped its vigorous rays,<br />
And o'er the letter'd world diffus'd a blaze:<br />
As womb'd with fire the cloud electrick flies,<br />
And calmly o'er the horizon seems to rise;<br />
Touch'd by the pointed steel, the lightning flows,<br />
And all the expanse with rich effulgence glows.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In judgment keen, he acts the critick's part,</span><br />
By reason proves the feelings of the heart;<br />
In thought profound, in nature's study wise,<br />
Shews from what source our fine sensations rise;<br />
With truth, precision, fancy's claims defines,<br />
And throws new splendour o'er the poet's lines.<span class="fn"><a name="f51.1" id="f51.1"></a><a href="#f51">51</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When specious sophists with presumption scan</span><br />
The source of evil, hidden still from man;<span class="fn"><a name="f52.1" id="f52.1"></a><a href="#f52">52</a></span><br />
Revive Arabian tales<span class="fn"><a name="f53.1" id="f53.1"></a><a href="#f53">53</a></span>, and vainly hope<br />
To rival St. John, and his scholar, Pope;<span class="fn"><a name="f54.1" id="f54.1"></a><a href="#f54">54</a></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Though metaphysicks spread the gloom of night,<br />
By reason's star he guides our aching sight;<br />
The bounds of knowledge marks; and points the way<br />
To pathless wastes, where wilder'd sages stray;<br />
Where, like a farthing linkboy, Jennings stands,<br />
And the dim torch drops from his feeble hands.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Impressive truth, in splendid fiction drest,<span class="fn"><a name="f55.1" id="f55.1"></a><a href="#f55">55</a></span></span><br />
Checks the vain wish, and calms the troubled breast;<br />
O'er the dark mind a light celestial throws,<br />
And sooths the angry passions to repose;<br />
As oil effus'd illumes and smooths the deep,<span class="fn"><a name="f56.1" id="f56.1"></a><a href="#f56">56</a></span><br />
When round the bark the foaming surges sweep.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But hark, he sings! the strain ev'n Pope admires;</span><br />
Indignant Virtue her own bard inspires;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Sublime as Juvenal, he pours his lays,<span class="fn"><a name="f57.1" id="f57.1"></a><a href="#f57">57</a></span><br />
And with the Roman shares congenial praise:&mdash;<br />
In glowing numbers now he fires the age,<br />
And Shakspeare's sun relumes the clouded stage.<span class="fn"><a name="f58.1" id="f58.1"></a><a href="#f58">58</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So full his mind with images was fraught,</span><br />
The rapid strains scarce claim'd a second thought;<br />
And with like ease his vivid lines assume<br />
The garb and dignity of ancient Rome.&mdash;<br />
Let college <i>versemen</i> trite conceits express,<br />
Trick'd out in splendid shreds of Virgil's dress;<br />
From playful Ovid cull the tinsel phrase,<br />
And vapid notions hitch in pilfer'd lays;<br />
Then with mosaick art the piece combine,<br />
And boast the glitter of each dulcet line:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Johnson adventur'd boldly to transfuse<br />
His vigorous sense into the Latian muse;<br />
Aspir'd to shine by unreflected light,<br />
And with a Roman's ardour <i>think</i> and write.<br />
He felt the tuneful Nine his breast inspire,<br />
And, like a master, wak'd the<span class="fn"><a name="f59.1" id="f59.1"></a><a href="#f59">59</a></span> soothing lyre:<br />
Horatian strains a grateful heart proclaim,<br />
While Sky's wild rocks resound his Thralia's name.&mdash;<br />
Hesperia's plant, in some less skillful hands,<br />
To bloom a while, factitious heat demands;<br />
Though glowing Maro a faint warmth supplies,<br />
The sickly blossom in the hot-house dies:<br />
By Johnson's genial culture, art, and toil,<br />
Its root strikes deep, and owns the fost'ring soil;<br />
Imbibes our sun through all its swelling veins,<br />
And grows a native of Britannia's plains.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft-ey'd compassion, with a look benign</span><br />
His fervent vows he offer'd at thy shrine;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>To guilt, to woe, the sacred debt was paid,<span class="fn"><a name="f60.1" id="f60.1"></a><a href="#f60">60</a></span><br />
And helpless females bless'd his pious aid:<br />
Snatch'd from disease, and want's abandon'd crew,<br />
Despair and anguish from their victims flew;<br />
Hope's soothing balm into their bosoms stole,<br />
And tears of penitence restor'd the soul.<br />
Nor did philanthrophy alone expand<br />
His liberal heart, and ope his bounteous hand;<br />
His <i>talents</i> ev'n he gave to friendship's claim,<span class="fn"><a name="f61.1" id="f61.1"></a><a href="#f61">61</a></span><br />
And by the gift imparted wealth and fame:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>His mind exhaustless sped its vivid force,<br />
Yet with unbated vigour held its course;<br />
As some fix'd star fulfills heaven's great designs,<br />
Lights other spheres, yet undiminish'd shines.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How few distinguish'd of the studious train</span><br />
At the gay board their empire can maintain!<br />
In their own books intomb'd their wisdom lies;<br />
Too dull for talk, their slow conceptions rise:<br />
Yet the mute author, of his writings proud,<br />
For wit unshewn claims homage from the crowd;<br />
As thread-bare misers, by mean avarice school'd,<br />
Expect obeisance from their hidden gold.&mdash;<br />
In converse quick, impetuous Johnson press'd<br />
His weighty logick, or sarcastick jest:<br />
Strong in the chace, and nimble in the turns,<span class="fn"><a name="f62.1" id="f62.1"></a><a href="#f62">62</a></span><br />
For victory still his fervid spirit burns;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Subtle when wrong, invincible when right,<br />
Arm'd at all points, and glorying in his might,<br />
Gladiator-like, he traverses the field,<br />
And strength and skill compel the foe to yield.&mdash;<br />
Yet have I seen him, with a milder air,<br />
Encircled by the witty and the fair,<br />
Ev'n in old age with placid mien rejoice<br />
At beauty's smile, and beauty's flattering voice.&mdash;<br />
With Reynolds' pencil, vivid, bold, and true,<br />
So fervent Boswell gives him to our view.<br />
In every trait we see his mind expand;<br />
The master rises by the pupil's hand;<br />
We love the writer, praise his happy vein,<br />
Grac'd with the naivet&eacute; of the sage Montaigne.<br />
Hence not alone are brighter parts display'd,<br />
But ev'n the specks of character portray'd:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>We <i>see</i> the Rambler with fastidious smile<br />
Mark the lone tree, and note the heath-clad isle;<br />
But when the heroick tale of Flora charms,<span class="fn"><a name="f63.1" id="f63.1"></a><a href="#f63">63</a></span><br />
Deck'd in a kilt, he wields a chieftain's arms:<br />
The tuneful piper sounds a martial strain,<br />
And Samuel sings, "The King shall have his ain":<br />
Two Georges in his loyal zeal are slur'd,<span class="fn"><a name="f64.1" id="f64.1"></a><a href="#f64">64</a></span><br />
A gracious pension only saves the third!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Nature's gifts ordain'd mankind to rule,</span><br />
He, like a Titian, form'd his brilliant school;<br />
And taught congenial spirits to excel,<br />
While from his lips impressive wisdom fell.<br />
Our boasted <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span> felt the sovereign sway;<br />
From him deriv'd the sweet yet nervous lay.<br />
To Fame's proud cliff he bade our Raphael rise;<br />
Hence <span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>' pen with <span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>' pencil vyes.<br />
With Johnson's flame melodious <span class="smcap">Burney</span> glows,<span class="fn"><a name="f65.1" id="f65.1"></a><a href="#f65">65</a></span><br />
While the grand strain in smoother cadence flows.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>And you, <span class="smcap">Malone</span>, to critick learning dear,<br />
Correct and elegant, refin'd, though clear,<br />
By studying him, acquir'd that classick taste,<br />
Which high in Shakspeare's fane thy statue plac'd.<br />
Near Johnson <span class="smcap">Steevens</span> stands, on scenick ground,<br />
Acute, laborious, fertile, and profound.<br />
Ingenious <span class="smcap">Hawkesworth</span> to this school we owe,<br />
And scarce the pupil from the tutor know.<br />
Here early parts accomplish'd <span class="smcap">Jones</span><span class="fn"><a name="f66.1" id="f66.1"></a><a href="#f66">66</a></span> sublimes,<br />
And science blends with Asia's lofty rhimes:<br />
Harmonious <span class="smcap">Jones</span>! who in his splendid strains<br />
Sings Camdeo's sports, on Agra's flowery plains;<br />
In Hindu fictions while we fondly trace<br />
Love and the Muses, deck'd with Attick grace.<span class="fn"><a name="f67.1" id="f67.1"></a><a href="#f67">67</a></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Amid these names can <span class="smcap">Boswell</span> be forgot,<br />
Scarce by North Britons now esteem'd a Scot?<span class="fn"><a name="f68.1" id="f68.1"></a><a href="#f68">68</a></span><br />
Who to the sage devoted from his youth,<br />
Imbib'd from him the sacred love of truth;<br />
The keen research, the exercise of mind,<br />
And that best art, the art to know mankind.&mdash;<br />
Nor was his energy confin'd alone<br />
To friends around his philosophick throne;<br />
Its influence wide improv'd our letter'd isle,<br />
And lucid vigour mark'd the general style:<br />
As Nile's proud waves, swol'n from their oozy bed,<br />
First o'er the neighbouring meads majestick spread;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Till gathering force, they more and more expand,<br />
And with new virtue fertilise the land.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus sings the Muse, to Johnson's memory just,</span><br />
And scatters praise and censure o'er his dust;<br />
For through each checker'd scene a contrast ran,<br />
Too sad a proof, how great, how weak is man!<br />
Though o'er his passions conscience held the rein,<br />
He shook at dismal phantoms of the brain:<br />
A boundless faith that noble mind debas'd,<br />
By piercing wit, energick reason grac'd:<br />
A generous Briton<span class="fn"><a name="f69.1" id="f69.1"></a><a href="#f69">69</a></span>, yet he seems to hope<br />
For James's grandson, and for James's Pope:<br />
With courtly zeal fair freedom's sons defames,<span class="fn"><a name="f70.1" id="f70.1"></a><a href="#f70">70</a></span><br />
Yet, like a Hamden, pleads Ierne's claims.<span class="fn"><a name="f71.1" id="f71.1"></a><a href="#f71">71</a></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Though proudly splenetick, yet idly vain,<br />
Accepted flattery, and dealt disdain.&mdash;<br />
E'en shades like these, to brilliancy ally'd,<br />
May comfort fools, and curb the Sage's pride.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet Learning's sons, who o'er his foibles mourn,</span><br />
To latest time shall fondly view his urn;<br />
And wond'ring praise, to human frailties blind,<br />
Talents and virtue of the brightest kind;<br />
Revere the man, with various knowledge stor'd,<br />
Who science, arts, and life's whole scheme explor'd;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Who firmly scorn'd, when in a lowly state,<br />
To flatter vice, or court the vain and great;<span class="fn"><a name="f72.1" id="f72.1"></a><a href="#f72">72</a></span><br />
Whose heart still felt a sympathetick glow,<br />
Prompt to relieve man's variegated woe;<br />
Whose ardent hope, intensely fix'd on high,<br />
Saw future bliss with intellectual eye.<br />
Still in his breast Religion held her sway,<br />
Disclosing visions of celestial day;<br />
And gave his soul, amidst this world of strife,<br />
The blest reversion of eternal life:<br />
By this dispell'd, each doubt and horrour flies,<br />
And calm at length in holy peace he dies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sculptur'd trophy, and imperial bust,</span><br />
That proudly rise around his hallow'd dust,<br />
Shall mould'ring fall, by Time's slow hand decay'd,<br />
But the bright meed of virtue ne'er shall fade.<br />
Exulting Genius stamps his sacred name,<br />
Enroll'd for ever in the dome of Fame.<br /></p></div>

Swift.&mdash;He said to-day,&mdash;I doubt if the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> was his; it
has so much more thinking, more knowledge, more power, more colour,
than any of the works that are indisputably his. If it was his, I
shall only say, he was <i>impar sibi</i>." Boswell's <i>Tour to the
Hebrides</i>, p. 38.</p>

<p>Doctor Johnson's "unaccountable prejudice against Swift" may probably
be derived from the same source as Blackmore's, if we may venture to
form a judgement from the panegyrick he bestows on the following
groundless invective, expressly aimed at Swift as the author of <i>A
Tale of a Tub</i>, which he quotes in his life of Blackmore: "Several, in
their books, have many sarcastical and spiteful strokes at religion in
general; while others make themselves pleasant with the principles of
the Christian. Of the last kind, this age has seen a most audacious
example, in the book intituled "<i>A Tale of a Tub</i>." Had this writing
been published in a pagan or <i>popish</i> nation, who are <i>justly</i>
impatient of all indignity offered to the established religion of
their country, no doubt but the author would have received the
punishment he deserved.&mdash;But the fate of this impious buffoon is very
different; for in a protestant kingdom, zealous of <ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'ther'">their</ins> civil and
religious immunities, he has not only escaped affronts and the effects
of publick resentment, but has been caressed and patronised by persons
of great figure of all denominations."</p>

<p>The malevolent dullness of bigotry alone could have inspired Blackmore
with these sentiments. The fact is, that the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> is a
continued panegyrick on the Church of England, and a bitter satire on
Popery, Calvinism, and every sect of dissenters. At the same time I am
persuaded, that every reader of taste and discernment will perceive in
many parts of Swift's other writings strong internal proofs of that
style which characterises the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>; especially in the
<i>Publick Spirit of the Whigs</i>. It is well known, that he affected
simplicity, and studiously avoided any display of learning, except
where the subject made it absolutely necessary. Temporary, local, and
political topicks compose too great a part of his works; but in a
treatise that admitted "more thinking, more knowledge," &amp;c. he
naturally exerted all his powers.&mdash;Let us hear the author himself on
this point.</p>

<p>"The greatest part of that book was finished above thirteen years
since, (1696) which is eight years before it was published. The author
was then young, his invention at the height, and his reading fresh in
his head." And again: "Men should be more cautious in losing their
time, if they did but consider, that to answer a book effectually
requireth more pains and skill, more wit, learning and judgement, than
were employed in writing it.&mdash;And the author assureth those gentlemen,
who have given themselves that trouble with him, that his discourse is
the product of the study, the observation, and the invention of
<i>several years</i>; that he often blotted out more than he left; and if
his papers had not been a long time out of his possession, they must
still have undergone more severe corrections." <i>An Apology for the
Tale of a Tub.</i>&mdash;With respect to this work being the production of
Swift, see his letter to the printer, Mr. Benjamin Tooke, dated
Dublin, June 29, 1710, and Tooke's Answer on the publication of <i>the
Apology</i> and a new edition of the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>. Hawkesworth's
edition of Swift's Works, 8vo. vol. xvi. p. 145.</p>

<p>Doctor Hawkesworth mentions, in his preface, that the edition of <i>A
Tale of a Tub</i>, printed in 1710, was revised and corrected by the Dean
a short time before his understanding was impaired, and that the
corrected copy was, in the year 1760, in the hands of his kinsman, Mr.
Deane Swift.</p>

Boswell's <i>Tour</i>, p. 67.&mdash;Here his only objection to
transubstantiation seems to rest on the style of the Scripture being
figurative elsewhere as well as in this passage. Hence we may infer,
that he would otherwise have believed in it.&mdash;But Archbishop Tillotson
and Mr. Locke reason more philosophically, by asserting that "no
doctrine, however clearly expressed in Scripture, is to be admitted,
if it contradict the evidence of our senses:&mdash;For our evidence for the
truth of revealed religion is <i>less</i> than the evidence for the truth
of our senses, because, <i>even</i> in the first authors of our religion,
it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from
them to us, through the medium of human testimony."&mdash;This question,
however, may perhaps be better elucidated by the following Anecdote,
preserved by Mr. Richardson, than by a more serious discussion:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pope, who loved to talk of Titcum, (one who used to be of the
party with him, Gay, Swift, Craggs, and Addison, and that set, in his
youth,) told us, that Gay went to see him as he was dying, and asked
him, if he would have a priest; (for he was a papist,) 'No, said he,
what should I do with them? But I would rather have one of them, than
one of yours, of the two. Our fools, (continued he) write great books
to prove that <i>bread</i> is <i>God</i>; but your booby (he meant Tillotson)
has wrote a long argument to prove that <i>bread</i> is <i>bread</i>.'"

<br />
In your last month's Review of books, you have asserted, that the
publication of Dr. Johnson's <i>Prayers</i> and <i>Meditations</i> appears to
have been at the instance of Dr. Adams, Master of Pembroke College,
Oxford. This, I think, is more than you are warranted by the editor's
preface to say; and is so far from being true, that Dr. Adams never
saw a line of these compositions, before they appeared in print, nor
ever heard from Dr. Johnson, or the editor, that any such existed. Had
he been consulted about the publication, he would certainly have given
his voice against it: and he therefore hopes, that you will clear him,
in as publick a manner as you can, from being any way accessary to it. <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>Wm. Adams.</p>

call the most remarkable one that ever appeared; since, besides the
former consideration, I shall presently shew, that it is no other than
that very comet, which came by the earth at the time of Noah's deluge,
and <i>which was the cause of the same</i>." Whiston's <i>Theory of the
Earth</i>, p. 188.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f40.1">40</a><a name="f40" id="f40"></a>] "Since 575 years appear to be the period of the comet that caused
the deluge, what a learned friend who was the occasion of my
examination of this matter, suggests, will deserve to be considered;
viz. Whether the story of the ph&oelig;nix, that celebrated emblem of the
resurrection in Christian antiquity, (that it returns once after five
centuries, and goes to the altar and city of the sun, and is there
burnt; and another arises out of its ashes, and carries away the
remains of the former; &amp;c.) be not an allegorical representation of
this comet, which returns once after five centuries, and goes down to
the sun, and is there vehemently heated, and its outward regions
dissolved; yet that it flies off again, and carries away what remains
after that terrible burning; &amp;c. and whether the <i>conflagration</i> and
renovation of things, which some such comet may bring on the earth, be
not hereby prefigured, I will not here be positive: but I own, that I
do not know of any solution of this famous piece of mythology and

of very great honesty, skill and reputation in his profession,
attested it.&mdash;It was believed by King George to be real; and it was
also believed by my old friends the Speaker and Mr. Samuel Collet, as
they told me themselves, and was generally by sober persons in the
neighbourhood. Nay Mr. Molyneux, the Prince's Secretary, a very
inquisitive person, and my very worthy friend, assured me he had at
first so great a diffidence in the truth of the fact, and was so
little biassed by the other believers, even by the King himself, that
he would not be satisfied till he was permitted both to see and feel

<p>"In this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it not
be forgotten that much likewise is performed; and though no book was
ever spared out of tenderness to the authour, and the world is little
solicitous to know whence proceeded the faults of that which it
condemns, yet it may gratify curiosity to inform it, that the <span class="smcap">English

<p>"But ice is water congealed by the frigidity of the air, whereby it
acquireth no new form, but rather a consistence or determination of
its defluency, and amitteth not its essence, but condition of
fluidity. Neither doth there any thing properly conglaciate but water,
or watery humidity, for the determination of quicksilver is properly
fixation, that of milk coagulation, and that of oil and unctuous
bodies only incrassation."&mdash;Is this written by Brown or Johnson?</p>

<p>[<a href="#f48.1">48</a><a name="f48" id="f48"></a>] In the <i>Ramblers</i> the abstract too often occurs instead of the

which was a regular lustration performed with bean-flower water and

which it was to be thickened, and by others to be curled. The softness
of my hands was secured by medicated gloves, and my bosom rubbed with

<p>[<a href="#f50.1">50</a><a name="f50" id="f50"></a>] Dr. Johnson's extraordinary facility of composition is well known
from many circumstances. He wrote forty pages of the Life of Savage in
one night. He composed seventy lines of his Imitation of the Tenth
Satire of Juvenal, and wrote them down from memory, without altering a
word. In the Prologue on opening Drury-Lane theatre, he changed but
one word, and that in compliment to Mr. Garrick. Some of his
<i>Ramblers</i> were written while the printer's messenger was waiting to
carry the copy to the press. Many of the <i>Idlers</i> were written at
Oxford; Dr. Johnson often began his talk only just in time not to miss
the post, and sent away the paper without reading it over.</p>

affected by the sight of several unfortunate women, whom he has seen
almost perishing in the streets, that he has taken them to his own

were written by Dr. Johnson, and given by him to his friend. At that
time Dr. Johnson was himself engaged in writing the <i>Rambler</i>, and
could ill afford to make a present of his labours. The various other
pieces that he gave away, have bestowed fame, and probably fortune, on
several persons. To the great disgrace of some of his clerical
friends, forty sermons, which he himself tells us he wrote, have not
yet been <i>deterr&eacute;</i>.</p>

and the hare."&mdash;If this observation be just, Dr. Johnson is an
exception to the rule; for he was certainly as <i>strong</i> "in the
course, as nimble in the turn"; as ready in "reply," as in "a settled
speech."</p>

<p>[<a href="#f65.1">65</a><a name="f65" id="f65"></a>] Dr. Burney's <i>History of Musick</i> is equally distinguished by
elegance and perspicuity of style, and for scientifick knowledge.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f66.1">66</a><a name="f66" id="f66"></a>] Sir William Jones produced that learned and ingenious work,
<i>Poeseos Asiatic&aelig; Commentarii</i>, at a very early age.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f67.1">67</a><a name="f67" id="f67"></a>] "The Hindu God, to whom the following poem is addressed, appears
evidently the same with the Grecian <span class="smcap">Eros</span>, and the Roman <span class="smcap">Cupido</span>.&mdash;&mdash;His
favourite place of resort is a large tract of country round <span class="smcap">Agra</span>, and
principally the plains of Matra, where <span class="smcap">Krishen</span> also and the nine
<span class="smcap">Gopia</span>, who are clearly the Apollo and Muses of the Greeks, usually
spend the night with musick and dance." Preface to the <span class="smcap">Hymn</span> to <span class="smcap">Camdeo</span>,
translated from the Hindu language into Persian, and re-translated by
Sir William Jones.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, considering the antiquity and early
civilisation of Hindostan, that both the philosophy and beautiful
mythology of the Greeks were drawn from that part of Asia.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f68.1">68</a><a name="f68" id="f68"></a>] The following observation in Mr. Boswell's <i>Journal of a Tour to
the Hebrides</i>, may sufficiently account for that gentleman's being
"now scarcely esteem'd a Scot" by many of his countrymen; "If he [Dr.
Johnson] was particularly prejudiced against the Scots it was because
they were more in his way; because he thought their success in England
rather exceeded the due proportion of their real merit; and because he
could not but see in them that nationality which, I believe, no
liberal-minded Scotchman will deny." Mr. Boswell indeed is so free
from national prejudices, that he might with equal propriety have been
described as&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Scarce by <i>South</i> Britons now esteem'd a Scot."</span></p>

<p>[<a href="#f69.1">69</a><a name="f69" id="f69"></a>] When Dr. Johnson repeated to Mr. Boswell Goldsmith's beautiful
eulogium on the English nation, his eyes filled with tears.&mdash;Boswell's
<i>Tour</i>, p. 431.&mdash;See also the Dissertation on the Bravery of the
English common Soldiers, at the end of the <i>Idler</i>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f70.1">70</a><a name="f70" id="f70"></a>] See <i>Taxation no Tyranny</i>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f71.1">71</a><a name="f71" id="f71"></a>] Though Dr. Johnson has called Hamden the <i>zealot of rebellion</i>,
yet that distinguished patriot could not have expressed himself with
more ardour in the cause of liberty, than Dr. Johnson does in the
following passage in his Life of Swift: "In the succeeding reign [that
of George I.] he delivered Ireland from plunder and <i>oppression</i>; and
shewed that wit, confederated with <i>truth</i>, had such force as
authority was unable to resist.&mdash;It was from the time when he first
began to patronize the Irish, that they may date their riches, and
prosperity. He taught them first to know their own interest, their
weight and their strength, and gave them spirit to assert that
<i>equality</i> with their fellow-subjects to which they have been ever
since making vigorous advances, and to claim those <i>rights</i> which they
have at last established."</p>

<p>The truth indeed seems to be, that Dr. Johnson, though he had been
bred in high-church principles, and always expressed himself in
controversial argument like a Tory, possessed a high independent
spirit, and appears to have been a friend to the rights of man. His
definition of the word <i>Caitiff</i>, in his Dictionary, may throw some
light on this part of his character. "Caitiff. [<i>cattivo</i>, Ital. a
slave; whence it came to signify a bad man, with some implication of
meanness; as <i>knave</i> in English, and <i>fur</i> in Latin; so <i>certainly
does slavery destroy virtue</i>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><ins class="correction" title="Hêmisu tês aretês apoainutai doulion êmar.">'&#919;&#956;&#953;&#963;&#965; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#945;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7972;&#956;&#945;&#961;.</ins></span></p>

<p>A slave and a scoundrel are signified by the same words in many
languages.] A mean villain," &amp;c. See also that animated passage in his
<i>London</i>, beginning, "Here let those reign," &amp;c.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f72.1">72</a><a name="f72" id="f72"></a>] It is observable that Dr. Johnson did not prefix a dedication to
any one of his various works.</p>
